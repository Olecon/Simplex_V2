This program is created to approximate curve of melting DNA/DNA complexes. It include three models: Non-self-complementary, self-complemented and hairpin, accounting for water expansion. This program can parset curves from spectrophotometer Cary 300 and Cary 3500.

Manual:
1) You should select devices.
2) The next stage is to click on the "Калибровка" button and use baseline
4) You can increase or decrease a range of approximate curve to move infitity lines on graph
5) You can perform a rough fitting of the thermodynamic parameters then perform a fine approximation
6) Finally, the hotkey 'Ctr-C' copy the selected table rows
